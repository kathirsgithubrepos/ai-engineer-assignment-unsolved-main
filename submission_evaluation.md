## üß† Task 1: Code Optimization Improvements

| Area              | Improvement      | Effect                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------- |
| Embedding Loop    | Batched          | 8‚Äì10√ó faster              |
| Cosine Similarity | Vectorized dot   | 2‚Äì3√ó faster               |
| Candidate Loop    | Neighbors only   | 50‚Äì200√ó fewer comparisons |
| Common Neighbors  | Set intersection | 3‚Äì5√ó faster               |
| Regex             | Simplified       | Slight gain               |
| Normalization     | Precomputed      | Consistent speed          |
| Timing            | Added            | Easier profiling          |

#### üìé Evidence 

##### Baseline Timings (Before Code Changes)
The image below shows the runtime of the original script without optimizations.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Task 2: API Performance Optimization

| Optimization             | Before                   | After                                         | Why                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Preload model once       | Load model every request | `MODEL = SentenceTransformer(...)` at startup | Removes repeated heavy loading     |
| Predict in-process       | `subprocess.run(...)`    | Direct Python calls                           | Avoids spawning new Python process |
| In-process visualization | `subprocess.run(...)`    | Direct visualization call                     | Faster, cleaner                    |
| Safe temp handling       | Manual temp cleanup      | `with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory()`          | No leftover tmp files              |

## Task 4: PR-based CI Model Evaluation

### Summary

Two PRs created to simulate improvement vs regression detection:

| Branch                       | Change                          | Expected Outcome  | Purpose                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| `location_match_tweak`       | Location weight ‚Üë               | ‚ùå Lower accuracy  | Regression test        |
